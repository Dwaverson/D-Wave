Goats were one of the first animals to be tamed by humans and were being herded 9,000 years ago.

Goat meat is the most consumed meat per capita worldwide

Goats can be taught their name and to come when called

The life span of a goat is about that of a dog

Goats have a gestation period (pregnancy) of five month and the average birth rate for goats is 2.2 kids per year.

Baby goats (kids) are standing and taking their first steps within minutes of being born.

Each kid has a unique call, and along with its scent, that is how its mother recognizes it from birth – not by sight.

Counter to the dominant stereotype about goats being willing to eat anything, they are actually very picky eaters. They have very sensitive lips, which they use to "mouth" things in search of clean and tasty food. They will often refuse to eat hay that has been walked on or lying around loose for a day.

Goats are herd animals and will become depressed if kept without any goat companions. So, it is unhealthy for a goat if a family just owns one as a pet.

Goats, being mountain animals, are very good at climbing; they’ve been known to climb to the tops of trees, or even dams!

Goats’ pupils (like many hooved animals) are rectangular. This gives them vision for 320 to 340 degrees (compared to humans with 160-210) around them without having to move and they are thought to have excellent night vision.

Goats are foragers, NOT grazers. It is actually unnatural to graze a goat on grass and increases the likelihood of them picking up harmful parasites. In their natural habitat, they roam mountaintops and reach up as high as possible to pick out choice bits of forage around them.

Goats have four “stomachs.” Their food moves first into the rumen (from which it is periodically regurgitated for more “cud chewing”), then to the reticulum, later to the omasum, and finally to the abomasum (which is most like a more sensitive human stomach).

Goats are burpers! This is due to the role of their rumen. The rumen, which in a mature goat holds four to five gallons of plant material, breaks down cellulose and acts as a fermentation vat. Of course, fermentation produces gas, and this gas escapes in the form of loud, healthy burps. Our goats can frequently be heard burping in the barn.

The earliest European settlers of America brought goats over on the Mayflower. By 1630, a Jamestown census listed goats as one of that colony’s most valuable possessions.

Goat popularity sured following the 1904 World’s Fair in St. Louis.

Goats don’t have teath on their upper jaw. Instead, they just have a strong dental pad. They do, however, have an incredibly mobile upper lip that helps them to sort through spiny, thorny twigs to find plants’ tender leaves.

Goat’s milk is the most popular kind of milk worldwide.  It’s naturally homogenized (meaning it doesn’t separate out into layers in its original state) and is easier to digest than cow’s milk

Among the many pets that populated the White House during Abraham Lincoln’s time in office were two goats, Nanny and Nanko. They were particularly beloved by Lincoln’s son, Tad, who even used them for chariot rides around the White House.

The incredibly soft and expensive cashmere is made of the downy winter undercoat produced by certain goats.

According to an Ethiopian legend, the stimulating properties of coffee were discovered when a goat herder found his flock frolicking with extra verve after consuming the red berries of the coffee shrub.

The scientific name for a domesticated goat is Capra aegagrus hircus. Goats are actually part of the bovine family and are closely related to cows and antelopes.

The world-famous “fainting goats” don’t truly faint when they get scared. Their muscles are temporarily paralyzed for roughly ten seconds when the goats feel frantic, and this results in them falling over.

Both male and female goats can have horns and beards. There are also some species of goats where neither the males nor the females have horns and beards.

Baby goats were called ‘kids’ first! Records indicate that the phrase was used to describe a young goat as early as 1200 AD. In contrast, the word ‘kid’ wasn’t used to refer to a human child until almost 1600 AD.

Lamancha goats have ears that are so small, you might think they were cut off! It is the only breed of goat to be developed in the US, and was first registered by the American Dairy Goat Association in 1958. They were first bred in Oregon by Mrs. Eula Fay Frey.
